  - It is an open-source project that helps to simplify the development of RESTful APIs in a fast and secure way.
  - It provides a set of tools and libraries for serialization, validation, authentication, and other common tasks related to building APIs.
  - It also includes built-in support for pagination, filtering, and other features commonly used in modern Web APIs.
  - DRF is based on the Django framework and follows its design principles, which means that it's easy to learn and use for developers already familiar with Django.
